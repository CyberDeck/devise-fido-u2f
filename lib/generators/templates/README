===============================================================================

Device FIDO U2F successfully installed to your application.

You need to:

1) Adapt your Devise models to include both the FIDO U2F registration and
   authentication modules, e.g. change

   'devise :database_authenticable ...'

   to 

   'devise :database_authenticable ..., 
    :fido_usf_registerable, :fido_usf_authenticatable'

2) Modify your application controller 
   (i.e. app/controllers/application_controller.rb) to always prepend the 
   'protect_from_forgery' within the action chain, e.g. change

   'protect_from_forgery with: :exception'

   to

   'protect_from_forgery with: :exception, prepend: true'


DISCLAIMER: IF YOU DO NOT APPLY BOTH CHANGES, IT IS LIKELY THAT 
FIDO U2F WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED!
